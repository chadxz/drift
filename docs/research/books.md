## Blue Fox: Arm Assembly Internals and Reverse Engineering

**Author:** Maria Markstedter\
**Publisher:** Wiley\
**URL:**
https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Blue+Fox%3A+Arm+Assembly+Internals+and+Reverse+Engineering-p-9781119745303

### What is This Book?

"Blue Fox: Arm Assembly Internals and Reverse Engineering" is a book published
by Wiley that focuses on ARM assembly internals and reverse engineering
techniques. This book combines ARM assembly programming knowledge with reverse
engineering skills, making it valuable for understanding both how to write ARM
assembly and how to analyze existing ARM binaries.

### Why This Resource is Useful

1. **Reverse engineering focus** - Combines ARM assembly knowledge with reverse
   engineering techniques, which is valuable for analyzing binaries

2. **Internals coverage** - Provides deep insight into ARM architecture
   internals

3. **Practical application** - Likely includes practical examples of reverse
   engineering ARM binaries

4. **Wiley quality** - Wiley is a respected technical publisher with rigorous
   editorial standards

5. **Dual perspective** - Covers both writing ARM assembly and understanding
   compiled ARM code

### How It Relates to This Project

This book would be valuable for:

- **Understanding compiled code** - Learning how your ARM64 assembly code
  appears when disassembled
- **Reverse engineering** - Analyzing ARM binaries (useful with tools like
  radare2)
- **Architecture internals** - Deep understanding of ARM architecture internals
- **Debugging** - Better understanding of how to debug ARM assembly programs

### When to Use This Resource

- **Reverse engineering** - When you need to analyze or understand ARM binaries
- **Deep internals** - When you want to understand ARM architecture at a low
  level
- **Complementary learning** - To supplement forward engineering (writing code)
  with reverse engineering (analyzing code)
- **Debugging** - When you need to understand how your code appears in
  disassemblers

### Note

Check the book's table of contents and description to confirm:

- Which ARM architecture it covers (ARM32 vs ARM64)
- The specific reverse engineering tools and techniques covered
- The balance between assembly programming and reverse engineering content
- Whether it aligns with your project's needs
